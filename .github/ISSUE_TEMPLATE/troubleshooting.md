<!--------

I can't provide general troubleshooting help. However, the extended community of
users can provide more help: 

Issues should capture only bug reports and feature requests. However, I understand that 
it is not always clear whether an issue is caused by a bug or incorrect usage of a feature/component.

Most support requests will be automatically closed. If the answer is quickly obvious, though, I 
might be able to provide a brief answer.
